Hi! This is the codespace for the Leaflet in the Lansing Live project. 
Lansing Live is a project created for Digital Humanities 340 at Michigan State University.
To use the template yourself, add your locations and their latitude + longitude to the venues.csv
Adding performances can be done through the app.py file. After those are added, place that file in the same folder as the index.
